# dsGo
Data structures impletioned with Go
### `base` or `safe`?
we give 2 versions of each data structrue, thread safe or not safe, api is just the same. for example:
```
// a base set
github.com/zrcoder/dsGo/base/set

// a thread safe set
github.com/zrcoder/dsGo/safe/set
```
the base version usually performances better than the safe one <br>
and the safe version usually used for concurrent scenes
### our data structures
[queue](base/queue)
```text
A queue gives you a FIFO or first-in firs-out order.
```
[stack](base/stack)
```text
A stack gives you a LIFO or last-in first-out order.
```
[set](base/set)
```text
A set can store unique values, without any particular order.
```
[bit set](base/bitset)
```text
A bit set is a fixed-size sequence of n bits.
```
[unionfind](base/unionfind)
```text
union find
```
[heap](base/heap)
```text
A heap with APIs easy to use, different from container/heap in standard lib
```
### data structures in standard library
sync.Map
```
A thread safe hash map
```
container/list.List
```
A doubly linked list
```
container/heap
```
A heap is a tree with the property that each node is the minimum-valued node in its subtree.
```
container/ring.Ring
```
A ring is an element of a circular list, or ring.
